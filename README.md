# mapMaker
Web app to create maps to visualize data. Starting with images and eventually video


MVP:
- With one set of data, create a single map of the world, with the color spectrum being chosen from the


Later on ideas:
- many data sets
- time series of them
- more complex color schemes (would be nice to have something like an ideal range and goes to red if too high or too low)
- more complex color scheme and time series interatctions, for example, having a fixed color scheme across time, which I haven't seen done super well yet
- think about other map making libraries
- potentially other data visualization, building your own graphs and other projects
- For technical people, getting data and graphing it, especially for financial data isn't a problem
  - but not everyone is technical
  - technical people are not always with their computer
  - Graphings isn't always convinient, for example, comparing big tech companies' market caps and PEs through time from my phone on a vacation wasn't feasible
- being able to get and graph data very easily from a website would be nice

Plan:
- We have several libraries to generate maps, I liked plotly, and its in javascript too, I may try some others, maybe we can
